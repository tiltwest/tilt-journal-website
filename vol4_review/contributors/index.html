        Jane Lilly Benale (she/her), a Navajo woman and an accomplished weaver, dedicated her life to the home and the loom. She was born in a hogan in 1930 in White Ruins, Arizona and lived until her death in July 2022 atop the Black Mesa region of the Colorado Plateau in northeastern Arizona. At the age of eighteen, Jane was already a master weaver. Every spring, she would shear sheep and goats, then clean the wool and mohair to spin into yarn. She would gather juniper berries, yucca plants, cactus prickly pears, and the roots of plants to make dye for the yarn. At the time of her passing, Jane was a ninety-three year old matriarch. Due to her failing eyesight, she wove her last storm pattern rug at the age of ninety-one. In the final years of her life, she continued her teachings by telling stories, talking about the importance of water, sheep, the land, the home, and the Navajo language. She always reminded people of the sacred space and time that a weaving and a loom hold. Never finish a rug when it rains. Never give food to people through a loom. And always pray before you begin weaving.

        Newton and Helen Mayer Harrison (he/him and she/her) are widely regarded as leading pioneers of the eco art movement. They worked as a team from 1970 until Helenâs death at age ninety in 2018. Over those many years, the Harrisons collaborated with biologists, ecologists, architects, urban planners, and other artists to uncover ideas and design strategies to support biodiversity and community development. The Harrisonsâ concept of art has embraced a breathtaking range of disciplines. They have been historians, diplomats, ecologists, investigators, emissaries, and art activists. Their projects have focused on watershed restoration, agriculture and forestry issues, urban renewal, and urban ecologies. The Harrisonsâ visionary approach to their work has expanded dialogue around previously unexplored issues, leading to practical solutions and implementations andâon occasionâchanges in government policy. They have also exhibited extensively with museums and galleries throughout the United States and internationally, including events such as documenta 8, the Venice Biennale, and the Bienal de SÃ£o Paulo.

        <strong>Edgar Cardenas</strong> (he/him) is an artist-scientist based in Detroit, Michigan. He holds a PhD in sustainability from Arizona State University and first became involved with Radio Healer in 2015 during his time in Arizona. In his 2019 book, <a href='https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/v979v472t' target='blank'><em>Between Two Pines</em></a>, Edgar outlines how an informed, engaged, and integrative art-science practice is essential if we are to address the complex sustainability challenges we face today. Through his interdisciplinary artwork, Edgar investigates the tangled sociocultural, ecological, political, and economic forces that shape human/environment relationships. His work emphasizes the need for communion with everyday ecologies to illuminate what is obvious but often overlooked: we are not separate from our environments or from one another. Edgar is currently finalizing his second book, <em>Meanwhile in Detroit</em>, exploring his relationship to wildness in the city. He is also an associate director for the <a href='https://tdi.msu.edu/' target='blank'>Toolbox Dialogue Initiative Center</a>, a consulting and research group at Michigan State University which facilitates collaborative capacity building with interdisciplinary teams and organizations. <br /><br /> <strong>Raven Deshalecoweney Kemp</strong> (he/him) is a Native American artist based in Phoenix, Arizona. A member of the Navajo Nation, as well as the Muscogee-Creek, Choctaw, and Euchee tribal nations of Oklahoma, Raven was raised in a family of artists with strong ties to the local Native community. His studio practice includes painting, printmaking, computer programming, and sound art. Over time, Raven has had opportunities to collaborate with Native and nonprofit organizations such as the Muscogee-Creek Nation, Native American Connections, the Phoenix Indian Center, Pueblo Grande Museum, and the Heard Museum. One of his most significant collaborations has been his ongoing involvement with Radio Healer, which he joined in 2012. Through his work with the collective, Raven has built indigenous electronic instruments, performed experimental music and sound, and served as a storyteller. He uses his creative expression to advance indigenous cyberpunk and science fiction. <br /><br /> <strong>CristÃ³bal MartÃ­nez</strong> (he/him) is Mestizo of the Genizaro, Pueblo, Manito, and Chicano people of Northern New Mexico. He holds a PhD in rhetoric, composition, and linguistics from Arizona State University and is currently chair of the Department of Art and Technology at the San Francisco Art Institute. In 2003 CristÃ³bal co-founded Radio Healer; in 2009 he joined the art collective <a href='http://postcommodity.com/' target='blank'>Postcommodity</a>; and in 2018 he co-created the experimental electronic music duet Red Culebra. CristÃ³bal has dedicated his career to interdisciplinary collaboration, and he remains a prolific artist in all of these groups. Along with his partners in Postcommodity, he has exhibited work in the 18th Biennale of Sydney, the 2017 Whitney Biennial, documenta 14, and the Carnegie International, 57th Edition. The collective was awarded the Fine Prize at the Carnegie International, 57th Edition, and they have also received an Art of Change fellowship from the Ford Foundation. In 2021-22, in collaboration with Wapatah: Centre for Indigenous Visual Knowledge at OCAD University, Postcommodity presented *Time Holds All the Answersâ*a major museum exhibition with a comprehensive monographâat Remai Modern in Saskatoon. <br /><br /> <strong>Meredith Martinez</strong> (she/her) is a fiction writer based in Phoenix, Arizona. She earned her MFA in creative writing from the MFA Program for Writers at Warren Wilson College. Her work focuses on intersections between socio-cultural and environmental forms of violence and explores the ways in which one finds meaning in oneâs life and relationships in the context of climate-related instability, loss, and grief. Meredith is currently working on her first novel, <em>Vulture</em>, a near-future story of intergenerational friendship which extends realities of unchecked development, ecosystem destruction, water shortages, heat-related illness, and other vulnerabilities related to securing food, medicine, and shelter in the Sonoran Desert. Her writing has appeared in <em>Contrary Magazine</em>, the <em>New Orleans Review</em>, and Dzanc Booksâ <em>Best of the Web</em> anthology, among other publications, and she served as an editor for the 2016 inaugural volume of <em>Everything Change: An Anthology of Climate Fiction</em>, produced by the Imagination and Climate Futures Initiative at Arizona State University. Meredith has been a member of Radio Healer since 2007.

Since then he has explored various technologies such as VR with Skydance Interactive and custom game engines with Evening Star Studios. Esteban applies these experiences to his artistic collaborations with SWEAT, building responsive game systems that viewers often âplayâ without realizing that they have been drawn into a game. In his spare time, Esteban writes about game design for his website, <a href='http://estebanfajardo.com' target='blank'>estebanfajardo.com</a>. Raised in Denver, he returns to the mountains every chance he gets. <br /><br /> <strong>Rafael Fajardo</strong> (he/him) is an artist, designer, researcher, and educator.

        Xiuhtezcatl (he/him) is a musician, activist, model, and entrepreneur who pushes the envelope of what hip hop can look and sound like. His message and depth transcend his youth, yet his music is packed with hard-hitting grit. His thought-provoking lyrics are anchored by his Mexica roots on his father's side and by the passion for environmental justice work he inherited from his mother. Xiuhtezcatl served as youth director of Earth Guardians, a worldwide environmental organization, until 2019. Bilingual and skilled with code switching, he incorporates Spanish and English interchangeably into his music, which explores culture, legacy, identity, and his struggles as a young Indigenous man growing up as a minority in mainstream America. Xiuhtezcatl has performed and collaborated with artists such as Raury, WILLOW, and Jaden. He is one third of the emerging hip hop group Voice Runners, along with Los Angeles-based artist Tru and producer Jaiia Cerff. In 2020 the trio dropped a series of singles that culminated with the self-titled <a href='https://music.apple.com/us/artist/voice-runners/1490476242' target='blank'><em>Voice Runners</em></a> album. Xiuhtezcatlâs most recent album, <a href='https://music.apple.com/us/album/xi-xi/1597634572' target='blank'><em>XI:XI</em></a>, was released in December 2021.
